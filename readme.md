# Welcome to my Character Generator

# Requirements
This app requires Python 3 to be used. The internal libraries have been downloaded into a Virtual Environment so nothing else requires installation. The libraries used within this program can be found in requirements.txt. This program is not powerful and should run on all windows or linux systems, regardless of their specifications. 

## How to Install and Run
The repository for the code can be found at https://github.com/BenGormanCode/NPC-Generator.

To start the app, it can be run through the terminal with 'python3 main.py'. 

## Summary
The external libraries used in this project are Inquirer, Typer, Colored, autopep8 and Emoji.

These licenses have been designated as a way to protect the creators from liability and defamation. As the licenses merely seek to protect the providers of legal damages there is no ethical impact in using them. These libraries are widely used from sources with heavy amounts of activity. The security risks of this program are non-existant as the libraries that have been downloaded are safe and there is no communication outside of the program itself. 

I have included the licenses for these libraries below. 

## Licensing
Inquirer, Typer autopep8 and Colored all use the MIT license. This is a common license for open-source programs to allow programmers to use their library without being liable for damages it may cause. I have included the license below. 

Emoji uses the 3-clause BSD license. This license, as it's name suggests, includes a statement that prevents libility, and follows 3 main clauses. 
- When redistributing the source code, include the license
